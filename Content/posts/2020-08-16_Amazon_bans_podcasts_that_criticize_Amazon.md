> Amazon announced that its new podcasting platform, streaming on Audible and Amazon Music, would come with license terms banning criticism of Amazon

> Now, Amazon backed off from its nondisparagement clause pretty quick, but the existence of that clause tells us an awful lot. It's not like one of Amazon's lawyers slipped and accidentally wrote a nondisparagement clause.

Citing the terms directly:

> “Your Content may not include advertising or messages that disparage or are directed against Amazon or any Service”

They have backed down now, but still. Not a good look.

Don’t use closed podcast platforms. Stick to the original, open, RSS based stuff. Nobody can ban your podcast there, you can use whatever app you like, and you’re not dependent on anybody.
