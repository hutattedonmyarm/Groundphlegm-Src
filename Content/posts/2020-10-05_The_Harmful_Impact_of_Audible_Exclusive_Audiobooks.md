I recently switched from Audible to [libro.fm](https://libro.fm), and I was pretty shocked at how many titles are exclusive to Audible. Other than that, I do like it, except some minor issues. (I can't open a membership from Germany, but I can *gift* one, so I just gifted myself one; and they haven't added any German publishers yet, but are working on it)

With the usual issues surrounding exclusives, Audible has two main extra problems:

* [Audible will not carry any audiobooks unless they have DRM](https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/08/attack-surface-kickstarter/#asks)
* Libraries, bookstores, schools, and anyone who isnâ€™t affiliated with Amazon cannot distribute audiobooks that are Audible Exclusives.

Yes, libraries! People, libraries are important! Both for accessibility and for getting people interested in reading. And it also hurts your favorite local bookstore.
