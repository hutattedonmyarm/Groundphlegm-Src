> (Researchers originally dubbed it EvilQuest until they discovered the Steam game series of the same name.)

I’d be interested to know how that has affected their sales!

> In addition to ransomware, ThiefQuest has a whole other set of spyware capabilities that allow it to exfiltrate files from an infected computer, search the system for passwords and cryptocurrency wallet data, and run a robust keylogger to grab passwords, credit card numbers, or other financial information as a user types it in. The spyware component also lurks persistently as a backdoor on infected devices, meaning it sticks around even after a computer reboots, and could be used as a launchpad for additional, or "second stage," attacks. Given that ransomware is so rare on Macs to begin with, this one-two punch is especially noteworthy.

That hurts. Be safe people!

> Though ThiefQuest is packed with menacing features, it's unlikely to infect your Mac anytime soon unless you download pirated, unvetted software.

Well, torrenting does have a reputation for being filled with malware, looks like it’s not going to change any time soon.

> For your Mac to become infected, you would need to torrent a compromised installer and then dismiss a series of warnings from Apple in order to run it.

You know, I despise how much macOS and iOS in recent years have started plastering the user with warning and password dialogs. It’s perfectly normal to have to re-enter your AppleID password after opening ~~iTunes~~ Music or ~~I~~Books after a while. And *this* is the reason what that’s bad. People get used to ignore warnings and start blindly inputting their passwords when prompted
