First of all: WWDC is in two weeks, so we’ll then see if that’s true or not. Rumors about Apple transitioning to ARM have been going on for a while now.

I personally would *love* a well done transition. But only if it includes support for AMD64 for a few more years. They *just* dropped support for 32-bit Applications in Catalina, so I guess they’re not completely dropping AMD64 soon. Their past processor architecture transitions have been pretty smooth, so I have some faith.

Apple has been unhappy with their Intel chips for a while now, and I think that hey haven’t switched to AMD yet is a sign that they’re actually working in custom Mac chips.

I will be staying clear of the first generation ones, but my current Laptop is due to being replaced during the next 2-3 years. I hope all major issues have died until then.
