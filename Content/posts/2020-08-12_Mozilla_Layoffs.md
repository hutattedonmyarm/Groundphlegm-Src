This is a sad announcement. [According to ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-lays-off-250-employees-while-it-refocuses-on-commercial-products/) they'll lose a ton of revenue which would've been provided by Google in the future:

> Furthermore, Mozilla's contract with Google to include Google as the default search provider inside Firefox is set to expire later this year, and the contract has not been renewed. The Google deal has historically accounted for around 90% of all of Mozilla's revenue, and without it experts see a dim future for Mozilla past 2021.

As a fan of [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) I didn't particularly *like* them havign Google as thwir default search engine, but I did accept it as a decent form of revenue for them.

I've seen a lot of criticism about how they should focus on Firefox and not all the other crap that's "nobody needs" and "only costs them personnel".
As I see it, making a browser isn't exactly profitable, even if I'd love them to focus a lot on it.

Selling us cool stuff and using that to finance developing Firefox seems to me a better idea, which seems somewhat to be what they're aiming for:

> New focus on economics. Recognizing that the old model where everything was free has consequences, means we must explore a range of different business opportunities and alternate value exchanges.

There's a bit more detail in the memo which is linked in their blog post:

> We are organizing a new product organization outside of Firefox that will both ship new products faster and develop new revenue streams. Our initial investments will be Pocket, Hubs, VPN,Web Assembly and security and privacy products.

I'd *love* to see Pocket get some more love. I had been using it before their aquisition and was delighted to see Mozilla buying Pocket. And then they did nothing with it. The redesign is meh (the tile layout has room to display things I don't care about like "this article is super popular", but not to view my own tags) and their API exists, but is super crap.
I'd be super willing to get Pocket premium, but there's not a single feature in there I'm interested in.

I sincerely hope that they'll be able to provide good value services to us in the future.

Oh, btw, they [killed entire threat management team](https://twitter.com/MichalPurzynski/status/1293220570885062657).That's gonna backfire.
