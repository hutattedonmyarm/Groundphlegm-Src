Thanks NYT for the rather clunky title. But it *does* summarise pretty well what happened, so I’ll excuse it. In short: SpaceX launched Crew Dragon with Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley into orbit (would’ve been nice to have at least one female astronaut in there… <em>*</em>), they remained 64 days aboard the ISS, and now returned back into the blue of the blue planet.

Behnken and Hurley helped the sole Christopher J. Cassidy on it with the chores, did four space walks, operated the robot arm, and contributed to some experiments.

<p class="footnote"><em>*</em>I get it, they’re Bob & Doug. Very good friends, both space veterans and generally a very solid choice. However it does leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Also, I need to dig into how to do footnotes, Ink (the Markdown parser used by Publish) doesn’t do the <code>[^1]</code> style</p>
