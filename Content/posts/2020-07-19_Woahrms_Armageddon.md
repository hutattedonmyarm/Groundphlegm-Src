Wow! I’m a big fan of the old Worms games. World Party was my favourite back then, but Armageddon has held up a lot better. I’ll go ahead and install it again :)

So, what’s new?

- Support for higher FPS, animations are no longer capped at 50FPS
- More world selection options
- Windowed mode
- Saving the landscape in the middle of a game (including all craters and stuff), and loading that later
- Better support for newer OS
- A few bug fixes
