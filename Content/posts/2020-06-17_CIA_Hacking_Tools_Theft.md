In 2017 in [a bunch of hacking tools from the CIA](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/wikileaks-publishes-what-it-says-is-trove-of-cia-hacking-tools/) found their way into the hands of other people.

Unfortunately the linked PDF is only a scan, without OCR applied, so I’m not going out of my way to manually type the quotes from it.

Turns out, that the CIA’s security was a bit too lax and the whole shebang could’ve been easily avoided.

This is just a friendly reminder that “let’s make back doors but only for the good guys” doesn’t work.
