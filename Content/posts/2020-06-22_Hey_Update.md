> First thing this morning, we released the newly-approved 1.0.2 bug-fix update to our customers. A win for Apple, a win for us, and a win for our customers.

Good news!

> But then Schiller said “One way that HEY could have gone...is to offer a free or paid version of the app with basic email reading features on the App Store, then separately offered an upgraded email service that worked with the Hey app on iOS on its own website.”

While I’m happy for Hey, I’m disappointed that it wasn’t because of a change on Apple’s side
