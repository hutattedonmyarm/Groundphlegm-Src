Cory Doctorow is talking on his excellent Pluralistic blog about the collapse of AMC, and the monopolies involved in it.

> What's more, AMC took advantage of America's nonexistent antitrust law to buy most of its competitors, making it the only screen in town for many of America's cities.

> AMC's demise matters, then, because it constitutes the bulk of American screens.

This is going to be interesting how the movie industry is going to look like in a year or two. AMC is dying, and Disney now has Disney+ and *could* just release the bulk of it's movies there. "Trolls World Tour" was a raging success and "Artemis Fowl" is going to be released exclusively on Disney+ too.

However, Time-Warner are cutting into Disney's profit (not that Disney isn't still making truckloads of money though) there:

> So Disney needs big screens, especially since its Plan B, streaming media through Disney+, is being demolished by Time-Warner/AT&T;, which is using Trump FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's obliteration of Net Neutrality to upcharge customers who choose Disney+ over HBO Max.
