Pharaoh was one of my favorite games (and I still dig it out every now and then - thanks GOG!), so I'm unreasonable excited for this.

> But weâ€™re also game developers, that means a couple things are going to change, a couple systems are going to be adjusted, the UI and UX are going to be different. So, do not expect a remaster where nothing changes, this is a remake.

Them being fans of the game gives me hope, and honestly, I prefer a remake over a remaster, mainly because the game actually works surprisingly well, so doing only a remaster would be a bit of a waste
