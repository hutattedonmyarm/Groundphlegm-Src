I’m all on the European Commissions side here. While it may be *legal* what Apple is doing, it’s just plain absurd and disgusting. I’m especially sad to see Ireland fearing for its tax heaven status and agreeing with Apple.

The best thing to happen is a tax reform and simplification of the EU taxation laws.

> Just a few hours after the General Court ruling, the EU unveiled sweeping tax plans aimed at more transparent, simpler and fairer taxes. The plan included provisions that put increased pressure on digital platforms, like Apple's App Store.

Luckily, the EU seems to agree with me.
