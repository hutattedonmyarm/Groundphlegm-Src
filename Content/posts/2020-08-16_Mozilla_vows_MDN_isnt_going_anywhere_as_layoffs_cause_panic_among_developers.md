During [Mozilla’s layoffs](/posts/2020-08-12_Mozilla_Layoffs) their whole developer network, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), team got kicked out. MDN is a *fantastic* resource, but Mozilla is promising tat it’ll stick around:

> “MDN as a website isn’t going anywhere right now,” the spokesperson said in an email. “The team is smaller, but the site exists and isn’t going away. We will be working with partners and community members to find the right ways to move it forward given our new structure at Mozilla.”

That doesn’t sound too promising if I’m honest. Oh, the site will continue to exist? And they’ll work with the community? Good riddance, I hope it will stay as good as it currently is.
