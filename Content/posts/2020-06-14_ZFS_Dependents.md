I’m a fan of changing language to be more inclusive and less offending. Changing the language helps changing the culture!

There aren’t any downsides to the change and `dependent` is clearer in describing the function anyways.

Not surprisingly, the comments (first on Github, then on r/zfs) started losing their shit, because, uhh…  Yeah.
