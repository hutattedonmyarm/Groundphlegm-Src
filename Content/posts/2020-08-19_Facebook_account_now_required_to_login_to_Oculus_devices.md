I had been following the VR Headset market for a few years, and been in the “I’m going to buy one sooner or later” market. When Facebook bought Oculus in 2014, I continues to keep up with news about them, but clearly said I won’t be buying an Oculus headset. Because, you know, Facebook. A couple years later (that is, earlier in 2020) I acquired such a headset and completely ruled out any of their HMDs. This has turned out to be a good decision, I’m incredibly happy with the one I got and now this:

<blockquote>
Today, we’re announcing some important updates to how people log into Oculus devices, while still keeping their VR profile. Starting in October 2020:
<ul>

<li>Everyone using an Oculus device for the first time will need to log in with a Facebook account.</li>

<li>If you’re an existing user and already have an Oculus account, you’ll have the option to log in with Facebook and merge your Oculus and Facebook accounts.</li>

<li>If you’re an existing user and choose not to merge your accounts, you can continue using your Oculus account for two years.</li>
<ul>
</blockquote>

**Fucking what now?** I *wish* this was surprising, but alas, I’m only surprised it has taken them so long
