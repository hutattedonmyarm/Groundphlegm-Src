I’ve seen a few different takes on that. Some say, that it was purely a social engineering thing and the attackers managed to gain access to Twitter’s internal tools.

> The second source added they paid the Twitter insider

I hadn’t seen before that the attackers *paid* their inside person, but seems believable.

Hopefully, Twitter will provide a post-mortem detailing the incident.
