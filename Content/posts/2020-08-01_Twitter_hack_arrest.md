Remember the big [Twitter hack](/posts/2020-07-17_Twitter_hack/) on July 15th? Well, we got our first arrests!

> Early on July 31st, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida law enforcement placed [a] 17-year-old Graham […] Florida [resident], under arrest. He’s accused of being the “mastermind” behind the biggest security and privacy breach in Twitter’s history

> […] he allegedly convinced a Twitter employee that he worked in the Twitter IT department and tricked that employee into giving him the credentials.

> […] [he] is currently in jail and being charged with over 30 felony counts, including organized fraud, communications fraud, identity theft, and hacking


A 22-year-old hacked called “Rolex” and 19-year-old “Chaewon” were also arrested.

These two managed to ID themselves with their real driver’s licenses to Binance and Coinbase where some of the stolen Bitcoin ended up.

> [Rolex] is facing five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for one count of computer intrusion. [Chaewon] is being charged with computer intrusion, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy, the most serious of which comes with a 20-year sentence and a $250,000 fine in the US.
