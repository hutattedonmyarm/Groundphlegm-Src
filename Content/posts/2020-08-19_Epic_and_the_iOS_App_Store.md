> Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store and has informed Epic that on Friday, August 28 Apple will terminate all our developer accounts and cut Epic off from iOS and Mac development tools.

This means scary *are you **really** sure this isn’t malware?* warnings for people trying to launch Epic’s games on macOS after that. Removing it from the Store? Sure, go ahead. Terminating the dev account? That’s a whole new level, considering it affects macOS too and, well, the notarisation process for macOS apps is used ”for security and malware stuff only”. We are exiting “security” territory. Not. amused.
