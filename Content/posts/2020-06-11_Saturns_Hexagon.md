I find Saturns Hexagon super interesting. The amount of guesswork is pretty high in this paper:

>  We have limited data about anything but the uppermost layers of Saturn’s atmosphere, and there are lots of physical properties that could be tweaked in search of a perfect match. But for now, this study presents one possible configuration of the model, described as a “proof of concept.”

But nonetheless, I’m happy to see that they’re working on it and started making theories. I hope that with more time they’ll get more accurate data
