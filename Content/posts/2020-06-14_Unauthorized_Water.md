This story is popping up again. General Electric has added DRM to their *fridges*, only allowing genuine water filters. Unsurprisingly, the GE ones are more expensive than they need to to.

I immediately had to think about Coryâ€™s excellent [Unauthorized Bread](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41085118-unauthorized-bread) which he also mentions in his blog post.
