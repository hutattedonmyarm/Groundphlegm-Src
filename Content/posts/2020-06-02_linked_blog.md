Initially I wanted to go towards the linklog style of content, mostly because "oh, look what I found" and a comment about it is what I do *anyways*, but obviously the first entry (and this one too!) had to be different. Whoops.

I didn't even have a decent way yet to do it the way I want (by turning the blog titles into a link to the original), but I just implemented that. There's still some things missing, it sort of works now!
