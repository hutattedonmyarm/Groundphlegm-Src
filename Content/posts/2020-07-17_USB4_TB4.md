While I usually prefer to use the original title of what I link to, it doesn’t work as well with podcasts, because, well, they talk about multiple topics and I just want to link to two of them.

John explains the jungle of Thunderbolt 3 & 4 and USB4 navigation quite nicely, here’s a direct link: https://overcast.fm/+Oc3ooK8/41:33

They touch the topic ARM Macs again too. It’s a fun episode, give it a listen!
