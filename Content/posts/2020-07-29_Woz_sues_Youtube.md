> Steve Wozniak is suing YouTube for allowing scammers to use his name and likeness in phony bitcoin giveaways.

> According to the lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, crooks have been posting videos on the platform claiming that Wozniak is hosting a bitcoin promotion.

> “YouTube has featured a steady stream of scam videos and promotions that falsely use images and videos of Plaintiff Steve Wozniak, and other famous tech entrepreneurs, and that have defrauded YouTube users out of millions of dollars,” the complaint reads.

The more YouTube gets yelled at for their failure to keep platform in check the better. I *know* it’s not easy to moderate these enormous amounts of content. But YouTube is doing such an incredibly shitty job, with videos getting demonetized for the most ridiculous of reasons, wrongful DMCA takedowns, radicalising and conspiracy rabbit holes **and don’t even have a decent way for content creators to complain**, that *something* needs to be done!
