Non-technical users do have their issues with the address bar. That’s why it has been simplified so much. Google is pushing in that direction too. Many many hours of hammering “look at the address bar and look at the lock” into my parents and grandparents heads could be lost when it starts to be perfectly *normal* that the address bar and page itself give different info on where you are on the web.

Just another issue to throw on the pile of reasons why I hate AMP
