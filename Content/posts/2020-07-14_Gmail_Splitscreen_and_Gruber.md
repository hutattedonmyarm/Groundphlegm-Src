I agree with some of his sentiments:


> Feel free to file Google’s release this week of an update to their iPad Gmail app with support for split-screen multitasking under “better late than never”, but this is so late it borders on the absurd. It’s like the difference between showing up fashionably late and showing up a week after the party.

[…]

>  And an email client is near the top of the list of the type of apps where someone would want to use split-screen. Five years.

However, look at this:

> I’d like to see all the vim, vigor, and vigilance Apple applies to making sure no app on the App Store is making a dime without Apple getting three cents applied instead to making sure there aren’t any scams or ripoffs, and that popular apps support good-citizen-of-the-platform features within a reasonable amount of time after those features are introduced in the OS.

I’m all for Apple throwing out scams, ripoffs, and maybe even yet another shitty micro-transaction-riddled “game” *targeted at kids*.

But throwing them out for not using features? **This sounds like hell**
It sounds *exactly* like the draconian ruleset the App Store is (sometimes rightfully!) called out to be. We don’t need to throw out apps just because they don’t implement a *convenience* feature. It’s not even about privacy or security, just convenience for the user.

Do I wish that more apps would adopt some feature more quickly? Yes! Do I shake my head at people using the Gmail app for their Gmail account, because they don’t think about alternatives or just configure their account with whatever app they want. *Absolutely!* But kicking an app out, because it’s not as convenient as others? Ugh. No. No, no, no!

> Video app that doesn’t support picture-in-picture? You’re out of the store. App doesn’t support dynamic type size but clearly should? You’re out. Poor accessibility support? Out. Popular email client that doesn’t support split screen? Out.

*Runs away screaming*

I think Apple should do more to incentivise good iOS (and iPadOS and macOS) citizens, and nice behaviour, but *forcing* them‽
