If nothing else, it's a good read. Go and check it out!

I certainly understand that Apple wants to prevent spamming on their platform, but I love automating stuff, so I find it's quite a shame. On one hand I'd like to have an official iMesage app on Windows (I do own a Windows machine after all), on the other hand... have you *seen* their Windows software? iTunes is even worse than its macOS counterpart was (and honestly, "Music" is still crap), and iCloud is basically non-functional for me. *If* it works it's slow, but usually it just doesn't work at all.
